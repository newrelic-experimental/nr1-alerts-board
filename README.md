# New Relic One Alerts Dashboard (nr1-alerts-dashboard)

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/nr1-alerts-board/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic-experimental/nr1-alerts-board?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic-experimental/nr1-alerts-board/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic-experimental/nr1-alerts-board)

## Usage

Create an Alerts Dashboard that goes beyond the traditional static view with health of your sevices. Not only you can use this dashboard for simplified clean UI but also for cross account entities in complex setups.

This Dashboard also provides a unique solution for Colour Blind community by not relying on colour coding but instead uses visual cues like Wobble effects or Pictorial references. All within the New Relic platform.

## Getting started

First, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. If you're unsure whether you have one or both of them installed, run the following command(s) (If you have them installed these commands will return a version number, if not, the commands won't be recognized):

```bash
git --version
npm -v
```

Next, install the [NR1 CLI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) by going to [this link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher) and following the instructions (5 minutes or less) to install and setup your New Relic development environment.

Next, to clone this repository and run the code locally against your New Relic data, execute the following command:

```bash
nr1 nerdpack:clone -r https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-alerts-board.git
cd nr1-alerts-board
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
npm install
npm start
```
